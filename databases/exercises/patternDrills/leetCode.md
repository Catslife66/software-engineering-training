## Consecutive Numbers - 180

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

```
Input:
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```

Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

Solution:

```
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
    SELECT id,
           num,
           LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev1,
           LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev2
    FROM Logs
) t
WHERE num = prev1 AND num = prev2;
```

## Product Price at a Given Date - 1164

Initially, all products have price 10.

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on the date 2019-08-16.

Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
Output:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
```

```
SELECT product_id, 10 AS price
FROM Products
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING MIN(change_date) > '2019-08-16'

UNION ALL

SELECT product_id, new_price AS price
FROM Products
WHERE (product_id, change_date) IN (
    SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date)
    FROM Products
    WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
    GROUP BY product_id
)
```
